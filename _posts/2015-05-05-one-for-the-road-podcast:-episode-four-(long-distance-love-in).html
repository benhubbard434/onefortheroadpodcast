<p>
	Hello all and welcome to May!
</p>
<p>
	This episode is a bit of a different one as the two of us haven’t been in the same room, or even continent for the recording. So, we got a couple of friends along to chat all things running… well, mostly ultras!
</p>
<p>
	On this episode we have a catch up with <a href="https://twitter.com/harrycapps" target="_blank">Harry</a> over Skype whilst she’s on honeymoon in Peru – get us! We chat about <a href="https://twitter.com/lissyruns" target="_blank">Lissy’s</a> <a href="http://lissyruns.com/2015/04/27/i-ran-the-london-marathon/" target="_blank">experience at the London marathon</a> (it gets a little TMI). There’s an On The Run recording from an <a href="https://twitter.com/melanosaurus" target="_blank">absolute babe</a> with a much better voice for radio than us and we finally chat to friend-of-the-show <a href="https://twitter.com/amagpieinthesky" target="_blank">Stephanie</a>.
</p>

	<h5>Show notes:</h5>
