<h1>ONE FOR THE ROAD</h1>
<p>
	a podcast about running… and the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>
	Brought to you by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harrycapps" target="_blank">Harry Capps</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lissyruns" target="_blank">Lissy Webb</a>.
</p>
<p>
	On our pilot episode we introduce ourselves and tell you why we’re here, we talk about our recent runner’s highs and runner’s lows, the first ever ‘On The Run’ and we discuss how not to be a Strava wanker.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Warning</strong>: contains some swears (soz, not soz).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Full disclosure</strong>: this is our pilot, we are total newbs at this and we are *literally* making this up as we go along. That being said, we <em>promise</em> to get better the more we do this and we will take all (constructive) feedback on board. You can get in touch on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oftrpodcast" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/oftrpodcast" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or by email on OFTRpodcast[at]gmail[dot]com. Just be nice.
